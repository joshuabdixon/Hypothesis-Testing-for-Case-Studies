# Hypothesis-Testing-for-Case-Studies

This repository showcases my expertise in data science and statistical analysis, illustrating how I approach real-world business problems. It contains several scenarios to demonstrate my ability to define problem statements, set objectives, select appropriate statistical tests, and extract insights that add value to an organisation.

It demonstrates my ability to solve business problems through data-driven approaches and statistical rigor. If you have questions about these scenarios or would like to discuss a potential opportunity, please reach out to me.

## Skills and Libraries Used
The scenarios in this repository reflect my proficiency with the following statistical techniques and Python libraries:

- **Statistical Techniques**:
  - T-tests (one-tailed, independent two-sample)
  - One-way ANOVA
  - Chi-square tests (for independence and proportions)

- **Python Libraries**:
  - `scipy.stats` for statistical analyses
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and dataframes

## What You'll Find
In each scenario, I have:

- **Defined Problem Statements**: Described the business problem in clear terms.
- **Set Objectives**: Specified the goals of the analysis.
- **Chosen Statistical Tests**: Selected the appropriate tests for the problem and explained why they were suitable.
- **Defined Hypotheses**: Outlined the null and alternative hypotheses.
- **Performed Analyses**: Executed the statistical tests and interpreted the results.
- **Reported the Findings**: Provided a summary of the results and their implications for business decision-making.

## Example Scenarios
Here are some examples of the scenarios I created to demonstrate my skills:

- **Loan Repayment Affordability with Commission**: I used a one-tailed t-test to assess whether an applicant's salary, supplemented by sales commission, is sufficient to meet loan repayment requirements. This involved evaluating fluctuations in commission and their impact on affordability.

- **Product Price Comparison**: I applied an independent two-sample t-test to determine whether there was a significant difference in average product prices between two stores. This analysis helped inform pricing strategies and competitive analysis.

- **Employee Productivity**: I utilised a one-way ANOVA to assess productivity levels across three different departments. This test helped identify if any department required specific improvements to increase efficiency.

- **Market Research**: I employed a chi-square test for independence to investigate whether there was a relationship between age groups and their preferred social media platforms. This analysis provided insights for targeted marketing campaigns.

- **Product Quality Control**: I conducted a chi-square test for proportions to evaluate product quality among three production lines, offering guidance on quality control and process improvement.

- **Determining Product Lines**: I used an independent two-sample t-test to determine whether fiction or non-fiction books generated more revenue, guiding the bookstore's product line decisions.

Feel free to explore the code and scenarios to see how I approach complex problems and derive valuable insights. If you find these scenarios helpful or have suggestions for improvement, I would appreciate your feedback. Thank you for your interest in my work!
