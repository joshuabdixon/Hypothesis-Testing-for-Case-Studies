        "\n",
        "- **Problem Statement:** A financial institution needs to determine if an applicant's base salary, supplemented by sales commission, is sufficient to meet loan repayment requirements. The base salary alone may not be enough, so the additional commission is crucial to achieving affordability.\n",
        "- **Objective:** Determine whether the applicant's base salary plus the commission meets the required threshold for loan affordability. This involves testing the impact of fluctuations in commission on the applicant's ability to repay the loan.\n",
        "- **Statistical Test:** One-tailed t-test.\n",
        "- **Reason for Test Selection:** A one-tailed t-test assesses whether a given mean is significantly greater than a specified value, accounting for variability in the data. This test is appropriate to evaluate if the average commission is high enough to supplement the base salary for loan repayment.\n",
        "- **Value to the Organisation:** This analysis helps the financial institution gauge whether the applicant can reliably meet loan repayments without conducting a full affordability test, which leaves a credit footprint. The outcome informs loan approval decisions and mitigates the risk of default due to income fluctuations.\n",
